Introduction
============

``EZMotion`` is a Python tool which aims to provide an easy and intuitive way to perform kinematic and dynamic analysis of mechanical and biomechanical multibody systems without requiring coding skills. The current implementation has been developed in Python 3.

A description on how to use the EZMotion tool and the necessary input files is provided in the :doc:`How to use </how_to_use>` and :doc:`Input Files </input_files>` sections. Additionally information regarding the modeling of the components of mechanical or biomechanical models and working examples are provided in :doc:`Modeling </modeling>` and :doc:`Examples </examples>` sections.
