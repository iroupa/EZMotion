# EZMotion
 
EZMotion_2D is a pure-Python tool to perform kinematic and dynamic analysis of mechanical and biomechanical multibody systems. 

## How to use

EZMotion_2D graphical user interface has two panels, Analysis and Visualization, that allow the user to select the input files required to perform a kinematic or dynamic analysis or to visualize the outputs of such analysis. 


The Analysis panel allows to perform the following analysis: <br> 
i) Inverse Kinematic Analysis <br> 
ii) Inverse Kinematic Analysis <br> 
iii) Inverse Dynamic Analysis <br> 
iv) Forward Dynamic Analysis <br> 

and Inverse or Forward Dynamic Analyis 
Forward
Dynamic Analysis, iii) Inverse Dynamic Analysis, iv) Musculoskeletal Analysis and v) Visualization)
that allow to perform a specific analysis or to visualize the outputs. Each panel is composed of distinct
sections that require specific input files or information. The user must use the tools available in the GUI
to provide the path of the input files or the required information before performing the analysis. Each
input file as a different file extension to simplify the correct identification of each input file. Next
sections include a presentation of each panel, the list of files required for each type of analysis and its
description.
