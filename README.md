# EZMotion

EZMotion is a Python tool that provides an easy and intuitive way to model and perform kinematic and dynamic analyses of planar multibody systems without requiring coding skills and visualize its outputs. The current implementation has been developed in Python 3, and its outputs have been validated against those available in the IFToMM library of computational benchmark problems [1].

## Dependencies

EZMotion requires the following libraries:

numpy (https://numpy.org/) <br>
scipy (https://scipy.org/) <br>
wxpython (https://www.wxpython.org/) <br>
pandas (https://pandas.pydata.org/)
<br>
## How to use

EZMotion has a graphical user interface with two panels, ***Analysis*** and ***Visualization*** that allows to run or visualize the outputs of a kinematic or dynamic analysis. A detailed description of how to use EZ_Motion, the files required for each type of analysis, and how to implement customized models is available in [docs](../../text.md) folder.
