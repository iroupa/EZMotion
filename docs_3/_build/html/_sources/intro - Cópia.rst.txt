Introduction
============

``EZMotion`` is a Python tool which aims to provide an easy and intuitive way to perform kinematic and dynamic analysis of mechanical and biomechanical multibody systems without requiring coding skills. 

The current implementation has been developed in Python 3.

Numerous commercial and free software, such as the `Anybody <https://www.anybodytech.com/>`__ ,  `Visual3D <https://www.visual-3d.com/>`__,  `ArtiSynth <https://www.artisynth.org/Main/HomePage>`__ or the `OpenSim <https://simtk.org/projects/opensim/>`__ can be used to perform kinematic and dynamic analysis of skeletal and musculoskeletal models. Most of these computational tools have graphical user interfaces and pre-built models that can be used straightforward by its users. However, to develop customized models a strong understanding about biomechanical modeling and coding skills is required. 

In contrast ``EZMotion`` is a free and user-friendly tool for those that do not have a background in engineering, to perform  the kinematic and dynamic analysis of skeletal and musculoskeletal models since it requires no coding skills.
