Introduction
============

``EZMotion`` is a Python tool that provides an easy and intuitive way to model and perform kinematic and dynamic analyses of mechanical and biomechanical multibody systems without requiring coding skills. The current implementation has been developed in Python 3.

A description on how to use the ``EZMotion`` and the necessary input files is provided in the :doc:`How to use </how_to_use>` and :doc:`Input Files </input_files>` sections. Additionally information regarding the modeling of mechanical or biomechanical multibody systems and several working examples are provided in the :doc:`Modeling </modeling>` and :doc:`Examples </examples>` sections. 

The files presented in the :doc:`Examples </examples>` section include examples of all kinematic constraint equations required to model multibody systems and of the structure of each input file required for the forward and inverse analyses.
