Introduction
============

``EZMotion`` is a Python tool that provides an easy and intuitive way to model and perform kinematic and dynamic analyses of planar mechanical and biomechanical multibody systems without requiring coding skills and visualize its outputs. The current implementation has been developed in ``Python 3``, and its outputs have been validated against those available in the IFToMM library of computational benchmark problems [1].

A description on how to use ``EZMotion`` to perform an analysis and visualize its outputs is provided in the :doc:`How to use </how_to_use>` section. 

The :doc:`Input Files </input_files>` section includes the list of all input files required for each type of analysis and their description. 

:doc:`Modeling </modeling>` section provides a detailed description on how to model  customized ``multibody systems`` within the framework of ``multibody system dynamics``.

The :doc:`Examples </examples>` section include examples of all input files required to perform: ``forward dynamic analysis`` of a single pendulum and a slider crank mechanism; ``kinematic analysis`` of a single body and a human lower body model and the ``inverse dynamic analysis`` of a four bar mechanism.
